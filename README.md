-----------------------------------modules usage in our project------------------------------

--><NumPy>

>>Used for high-performance numerical computing.
>>Handles large datasets efficiently with arrays and matrix operations.
>>Optimized for statistical calculations needed for stock market analysis.

--><Tkinter> 

>>Used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
>>Provides interactive elements like buttons, labels, and input fields.
>>Helps in designing a user-friendly stock prediction dashboard.

--><Pandas> 

>>Used for data manipulation and analysis, especially with stock market
datasets.
>>Reads and processes CSV, Excel, or real-time financial data.
>>Helps with time-series analysis for predicting stock trends.

--><Scikit-Learn> 

>>Used for machine learning (ML) algorithms in stock prediction.
>>Implements classification, regression, and clustering models for
forecasting.
>>Supports train-test splitting, feature scaling, and model evaluation.

-->Threading 

>>Used for running multiple tasks simultaneously without slowing the
app.
>>Ensures the app fetches real-time stock data without freezing the GUI.
>>Useful for background stock updates and model training.

--><TradingView API>

>>Used for integrating real-time stock market charts and data.
>>Fetches live stock price movements and technical indicators.
>>Provides interactive financial charts for better market analysis.

--><Pillow (PIL)>

>>Used for image processing in the application.
>>Helps in loading, editing, and displaying images such as stock charts
and UI elements.
>>Useful for rendering icons, logos, and background images in the app.
